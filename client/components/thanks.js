      <div>Thank you for supporting our server! It means a lot to our team that you support Rusty Stream, and we'd like to give you these gifts as thanks! Enjoy an assortment of supply signals, weaponry, and materials to help get you started or improve your base! You also recieve a special flair both in game and in the discord server! There are two steps to redeeming this kit.</div>
      <div className='gap'/>
      <div>1. Contact damp or Masterphart either on the discord or the server. If we are not around, send an email to admin@rustystream.com and let us know what email you donated with and the account name you wish to redeem the kit on.</div>
      <div>2. Once your account has been upgraded, you will have access to two kits, one is usable every 7 days, and the other is usable once per wipe. The kits can be redeemed in game by typing  "/kit [tier]kit" and "/kit weekly[tier]" like this:</div>
      <div className='gap'/>
      <div>ex.</div>
      <div>/kit legendkit</div>
      <div>/kit weeklylegend</div>
      <div className='gap'/>
      <div>With the exception of lifetime supporters, your bonuses will expire 30 days after donating. If you have the Elite lifetime package and wish to upgrade to an Ultimate tier, feel free to contact an admin, and you can upgrade your tier for $50! Thank you so much for supporting Rusty Stream, with much love from our admin team!</div>
